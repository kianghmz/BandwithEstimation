# Accurate Available Bandwidth Estimation using PathKatana

This Prototype provides a Python-based implementation of the PathKatana algorithm for accurate available bandwidth estimation over UDP.

##  Project Structure

- `sender.py` – Sends UDP packets with variable sizes and timestamps.
- `receiver.py` – Listens for packets, records arrival times, and logs results.
- `analyzer.py` – Processes the sender/receiver logs and estimates bandwidth using the PathKatana algorithm.
- `plot.py` – Generates plots comparing measured vs. theoretical delays.
- `sender_log.xlsx` – Automatically generated log from the sender.
- `receiver_log.xlsx` – Log generated by the receiver and augmented by the analyzer.
- `group_*.png` – Generated plots for each test group.
- `iperf-benchmark.png` – Benchmark result using `iperf3`.

## ⚙️ How to Run

>  You need two machines or VMs (e.g., Ubuntu in VMware), one as **sender**, one as **receiver**.

### 1. Run the Receiver
On the receiver machine:

python3 receiver.py
```

This starts listening for UDP packets on port `6000` and logs received data.

### 2. Run the Sender
On the sender machine:

python3 sender.py
```

This sends multiple UDP packet groups with various sizes.

### 3. Run the Analyzer
After transmission is complete and both logs (`sender_log.xlsx`, `receiver_log.xlsx`) are generated:

python3 analyzer.py
```

This will generate theoretical delay values, calculate MAE/MSE, and determine the best bandwidth estimate per group.

### 4. Generate Plots

python3 plot.py
```

Generates figures (PNG) visualizing actual vs. theoretical delays and detects the congestion point.

##  Benchmark with `iperf3`

To compare PathKatana results with a standard tool:

On the **receiver**:

iperf3 -s
```

On the **sender**:

iperf3 -c <RECEIVER_IP> -u -b 1G -t 10 --json > iperf_result.json
```

You can compare the bitrate from `iperf3` with your algorithm’s estimated bandwidth.

##  Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `openpyxl`

Install with:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib openpyxl
```

##  Notes

- The estimation is based on **absolute delay difference** after detecting a reference packet.
- Results are logged and visualized automatically.
- Bandwidth is estimated by minimizing **MSE** between measured and theoretical delays.
